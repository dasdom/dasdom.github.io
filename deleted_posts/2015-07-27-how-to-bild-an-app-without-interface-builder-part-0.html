<p>If you are using Interface Building and you think it's kind of magic what Interface Builder and storyboards do to bring your app to life, then this blog-series is for you. We will build an app from zero to App Store without using Interface Builder when possible. For the Watch app we'll need to have a storyboard because at the moment they are needed when building Watch apps.</p>
<p>About the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birthday reminder</li>
<li>Today extension</li>
<li>Watch App</li>
<li>Test Driven Development</li>
<li>No storyboard except for the watch App</li>
<li>Only one xib for the launch screen</li>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Swift 2.0</li>
<li>Light table view controllers</li>
<li>PaintCode for the custom table view cells</li>
</ul>
<p>About this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll write as I go. This means we will most probably find ourselves in a dead end sometimes and need to rewrite parts of the app.</li>
<li>I'm not an expert in Test Driven Development. This means the way I use it might be strange or even wrong. If you find problems with my code or my tests, please leave a comment or ping me at Twitter or App.net.</li>
<li>I'll try to publish a blog post in the series every Monday. Let's hope I succeed. :)</li>
<li>The code of the app will be open source. If you want to put your own version into the store, feel free to do so. The code will be released under MIT license.</li>
</ul>
