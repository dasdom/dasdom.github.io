# Sketch Notes At UIKonf 2017

I attended UIKonf (iOS developer conference in Berlin) this week. Great conference. I have been at UIKonf in 2014 but this time it was so much better for me because I talked to so many people. It's not that the people have been more open this time.

It's more like this time I met many people I knew from Twitter and Slack channels. In addition I have been grown more into the community since 2014.

Something else was different this time. For the first time I started to do sketch notes during the talks. I'm not good with sketch notes yet meaning that I cannot draw. As a result often I had to write words instead of drawing images. Nevertheless doing sketch notes helped me to stay focused and concentrated. And I still remember what was presented in most of the talks.

After each talk I published the sketch note to twitter and shared it with the speaker(s). This way the speaker got feedback about what key points I digested.

I used Notablility on my iPad. During the talks I edited the notes if necessary, for example when I first misunderstood the point or when the visual structure could be improved by moving stuff around. But I didn't change anything after the talk was over.

And here are the notes together with the links to the videos. Have fun!

## Unsophisticated Software Development

Unfortunately I stopped doing sketch notes during the talk because I didn't get the key points.
