<p>You sure know all the operator `?:`. With this operator the code snippet</p>
<p>[code language="objc"]<br />
int x;<br />
if (y) {<br />
    x = y;<br />
} else {<br />
    x = z;<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<p>[code language="objc"]<br />
int x = y ? y : z;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>But did you know that you can write that even shorter? When you look at the last code snippet the condition (`y`) is the same as the value we want to assign to `x`. In this case this can be written as</p>
<p>[code language="objc"]<br />
int x = y ?: z;<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And this is good because as a software developer you Don't want to Repeat Yourself (the DRY principle).</p>
