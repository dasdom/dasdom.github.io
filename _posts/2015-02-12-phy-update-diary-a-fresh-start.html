<p>In the Phy Update Diary I'm writing about the process of updating the first App I have ever put into the App Store.</p>
<p>In the [first post](http://swiftandpainless.com/2015/01/phy-update-diary-setup/) I wrote about using Quick and Nimble for behavior tests. After a few hours with behavior tests and problems when I updated to Xcode 6.3 I decided to go back to XCTest (it's not the fault of Quick and/or Nimble; they have been updated a few hours after the Swift 1.2 release).</p>
<p>I could remove them from the project but it feels better to start over and add the classes I have already written to the new project. And this is exactly what I will do.</p>
