<p>Some people may not know, there is a code snippet library build into Xcode. Recently I started to use it more often and figured out that it saves a lot of time while coding.</p>
<p>You can find the snippet library at <code>View &gt; Utilities &gt; Show Code Snippet Library</code>.</p>
<p>There are already some code snippets provided by Apple. But the real power comes with the possibility to add your own. To add a code snippet you select code and drag in onto the code snippet library. Xcode opens a popup which lets you edit your code snippet.</p>
<p>Let's say you type the following line a lot (as I do):</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true ">@property (nonatomic, strong) <object type> *<name /></object></pre>
<p>To add this as a code snippet select the code and drag it to the snippet library. Enter in the popup</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Title: Property Nonatomic Strong</p>
<p>  Plattform: All</p>
<p>  Language: Objective-C</p>
<p>  Completion Shortcut: propertynonatomicstrong</p>
<p>  Completion Scopes: All
</p></blockquote>
<p>and change the snippet to</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true ">@property (nonatomic, strong) <#type#> *<#name#></pre>
<p>The &lt;#type#> tells the snippet library that there should be a placeholder. This mean that, after you have included this snippet into your code, you only have to type a tab to jump to the &lt;#type#> to change it to the type you need.</p>
<p>I have put the snippets I use most onto <a href="https://github.com/dasdom/Xcode-Snippets">github</a>.</p>
