One often overlooked feature of Xcode are Behaviors.
I will go into more detail about Behaviors and how I used them in a future post.

In this post I show you, how to setup a Behavior that switches to a new tab when building starts and shows the build log in that tab.

First open the Behaviours settings in Xcode at *â€˜Xcode / Behaviors / Edit Behaviorsâ€¦â€™*.
Select *â€˜Build / Startsâ€™* and check the check box at *â€˜Show window tabâ€™* and put in the name ðŸªµ.
Then check the box at *â€˜Navigate to current logâ€™*.

With this Behavior, Xcode switches to the ðŸªµ tab when building starts and shows the build log in that log.

You should add a Behavior that switches back to the normal development tab, when building finishes.
My development tab is named ðŸ¤“ so the Behavior looks like this:
