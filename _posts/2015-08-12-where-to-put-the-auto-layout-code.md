Auto Layout is kind of magic. Like a sorcerer you **tell** the elements
where to position and how to behave. You don't put the elements to those
positions yourself. The universe moves them because of your spells. Kind
of.

But **when** should the spells be spoken? In other words when not using
Interface Builder, where should the Auto Layout code go?

From the documentation of the `UIView` method
[updateConstraints](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIView_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIView/updateConstraints):

> Custom views that set up constraints themselves should do so by
> overriding this method.

Because of this sentence I always thought Apple asks me to put the
layout code in this method. But here is the problem: This method is
called more than once by UIKit and adding the same constraint more than
once is an error. The suggested approach I found in the Internetâ„¢ is to
add a boolean to the view class and set it in `updateConstraints()`
to make sure to only run the layout code once.

From the documentation again:

> When your custom view notes that a change has been made to the view
> that invalidates one of its constraints, it should immediately remove
> that constraint, and then call setNeedsUpdateConstraints to note that
> constraints need to be updated.

This means `updateConstraints()`
is meant to be used in the case then the constraints within a view
change because of some events. For this scenario the name of the method
makes much more sense.

In nearly all of my layouts the constraints are fixed. Sometimes I need
to change the constant of a constraint. This can be done without
removing and re-adding the constraint. (The constant of a `NSLayoutConstraint`
is the only thing that can be changed after creation.)

Because of this, I started to put all the layout code in `init(frame:)`. But I
was not really comfortable with it because of the documentation
mentioned above.

But then I heard in a session video of the WWDC this year an Apple
engineer suggesting exactly that. And just yesterday I received an
answer to a bug report in which I described the 'bug' that `updateConstraints()`
isn't called. Turns out it wasn't a bug.

The Apple engineer wrote:

> In general, if the constraints will only be created once, it should be
> done in an initialization method (such as `-init` or `-viewDidLoad`, and
> so forth). Save -updateConstraints for things that are expected to
> change over the course of running the App.

Nice. I love when my feeling about how code should be written is
suggested by Apple.

Happy layouting!
