<p>In the Phy Update Diary I'm writing about the process of updating the first app I ever put into the App Store.</p>
<p>Here is the setup for the Phy update:</p>
<p>## Quick<br />
I will use [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) for the behavior tests. This is new to me. In the past I have used the build in XCTest frame work from Apple.<br />
The installation of Quick is very easy. I just had to follow the instructions of the github page.<br />
Because I'm not used to behavior tests I expect my tests to be a mix match of unit tests and behavior tests.</p>
<p>## Realm<br />
I will use [Realm](http://realm.io) as the database to store the formulas. Fist I tried to install Realm using the dynamic frameworks because I plan to only support iOS 8. But this didn't work. The linker complained that it could not find the framework. So I tried to install the normal framework and that worked.</p>
<p>## Getting the data out of the previous version<br />
In the version which is currently in the App Store used a plist to store the data. This is because the example in the book from which I learned iPhone OS development used a plist. At that time I had no idea that something like sqlite or Core Data existed.<br />
The plist had the advantage that is was quite easy to add data to it. But the structure reflects my experience at that time. For example I have arrays with sections and another property with the number of sections and the title for the sections. So there is a lot of repeated information in the plist.<br />
The first tries updating Phy used the same plist (never touch a running system). But it was quite difficult to understand why and what I had tried to solve with the complicated structure.</p>
<p>So this time I want to store the data in a more logical and easier to maintainable form. So I had to get the data out of the plist. First I put the data into another plist (using a Swift Playground) reducing the complexity by removing the repeated information. In a second step I used the generated plists to fill the Realm database. More about this step in the next diary post.</p>
