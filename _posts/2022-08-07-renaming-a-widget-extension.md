I'm working on an update for [my formulary
app](https://dasdom.dev/physics_plus_plus/).
Among other improvements, this update will add widgets.

Along the way I decided to add another widget so the name of the extension
didn't match anymore and I had to rename it.

First I feared that this could be as difficult as renaming a project in
Xcode.
But it turned out that I just had to replace all the occurrences of the old
name.

For now I'll keep the names of the entitlement files as they have been.
This is a problem for future Dominik.
