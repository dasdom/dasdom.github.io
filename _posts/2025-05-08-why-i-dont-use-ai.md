-- Douglas Adams

I try to avoid AI where ever I can.
I ecpecially don't use it for development tasks.
And here is why.

# I'm older than thirty-five

So, AI is against the natural order of things.

# Good solutions need time 

The AI can't come up with good solutions. 
It just presents one solution it figured out by adding strings to other strings. 
I have to figure out if it is a good solution. 
To figure that out, I need time. 
I need to think. 
I need to wrap my head around the problem I try to solve. 
Figuring out if something works is way harder if I didn't come up with the solution myself. 
Most people use just the solution the AI presents and don't care if it's a good solution.
I don't like that.

# The joy of using my brain

I like using my brain.
Figuring something out gives me a dopamine kick.
Finally finding a good solution for a problem is the reason why I love coding.
Why should I let the AI have all the fun.

# Selling cheap

Each input trains the AI.
By using AI I help it to finally replace me in my job.
I don't like that.

# Environment

AI is destroying the planet faster than my brain does.

# Society

AI helps rich people to get free labor from poor people.
In this scenario I'm on the side of the poor people.
The rich are too rich already.
I'm not willing to help make them richer.
More than I do already.

# You

What about you?
Do you use AI?
Why?
Why not?
