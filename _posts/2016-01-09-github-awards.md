There is this new site [github-awards.com](http://github-awards.com/)
that analyzes a github account and rates it according the number of
stars its repositories got. According to that site, [my Swift
ranking](http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=dasdom)
**worldwide** is 56. Holy shit! **56!**

(Sure, there are repositories that are separated into their one account,
like [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) that is done by [Ash
Furrow](http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=ashfurrow). Keep
that in mind when browsing this site.)

I am totally flashed about this. The main reason is
[BreakOutToRefresh](https://github.com/dasdom/BreakOutToRefresh) but
still: Holy shit!

If you have starred one of my repositories, thank you very much!
