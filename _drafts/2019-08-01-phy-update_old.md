10 years ago my first app got appoved in the App Store. This changed my life.

At the time I worked at the university as a physics teacher. And I needed a physics formulary on my new iPod touch. There is an app for that, right? There had been formulary apps in the App Store. But they didn't fit my needs. So I tried to build my own.

Back in the days apps had been written in ObjC. So I tried to learn ObjC and failed. A few month later I met a former colleague who showed me his app in the App Store, a rain radar.

I thought, if he can do it, I can do it. This time I bought a book about development of iPhoneOS apps. Fortunately an example project in the book was kind of what I'd like to build. From that example I hacked the first version of the formulary.

And with hacked I really mean hacked. The example in the book only had one view controller for a list of items stored in a plist. I needed several lists. So I put all the code for all the lists in that on view controller. This was my first massive view controller. I guess creating a massive view controller is some kind of initiation ceremony.

Then, 10 years ago, it was time to put it into the world by submitting it to the App Store. All good names had already taken and I'm really bad in naming stuff. So I chosed the name Phy. As expeced a bad name. :D

The app was unexpecelty successful. I made a lot of money from it. At least for my standards. And the experience I gained help to change career in 2011. I became a full time iOS developer.

Years went by and Phy started to look bad on new iPhones. I tried to rewrite it from scratch several times but lost interest each and every time. And finally a few years ago I had to pull it from the App Store because of the quality initiative by Apple.

Last year I decided to try it again and get it back to the App Store. But this time I used the old and really bad Objective-C code. I fixed the bug I knew of and rewrote some view controllers using Objective-C
