I"|<p>Since I read the [first issue of objc.io](http://www.objc.io/issue-1/) I try to make my view controllers as light weight as possible.</p>
<p>A month ago [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) wrote a [great blogpost](http://chris.eidhof.nl/posts/intentions.html) about his experiment with Ultralight View Controllers using [Intentions](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/articles/2014/2/single-responsibility-principle-ios). Chris uses a storyboard and adds a model container and intentions to it.</p>
<p>Personally I don't like the Interface Builder and avoid it when ever I can. To understand what Chris did and to decide whether I like it I had to change [the example code](https://github.com/chriseidhof/intentions) and get rid of the Interface Builder. You can download the project from [github](https://github.com/dasdom/intentions).</p>
<p>&gt; **tl;dr**: I first tired to but everything what was in the storyboard into a view class. But this resulted in a bloated init method for the view. I then realized that the view controller should be responsible for connecting all the intentions and hold a reverence to the model container. </p>
<p>###AppDelegate</p>
<p>Without a storyboard we have to create the window and make it key. And we have to define the rootViewController of the window.</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true ">#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "ViewController.h"
</pre>
