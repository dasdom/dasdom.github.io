I"‰<p>Since I read the <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/1-view-controllers/lighter-view-controllers/">objc.io post about light view
controller</a>,
every few month I come back to the same problem: find the best way to
write a table view controller. I have tried several different approaches
like putting the data source and delegate in a separate class or using
MVVM to populate the cell.</p>
