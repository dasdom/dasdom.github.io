I"³<p>Right after Swift was announced I read a post on a well known website that they are searching for people who want to create video tutorials for them. I volunteered and started to implement a demo project for the video tutorial, a timer app.</p>
<p>I made the videos and wrote the people from the blog that I'm finished and asked where I should send the video to. I never heard from them again.</p>
<p>So I decided to build a complete app from the demo project. Few days later I had the first version of Fojusi finished and put it in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/fojusi/id923044693?l=en&amp;mt=8">App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Then came the October Special Event. In the keynote Hair Force One showed a slide with a apps already written in Swift (<a href="https://youtu.be/sBfvJn-fpnc?t=16m5s">https://youtu.be/sBfvJn-fpnc?t=16m5s</a>). And I nearly fall from the couch as I realized that Fojusi was on that slide (bottom right corner).</p>

<p>A few days ago I decided to make Fojusi <a href="https://github.com/dasdom/Tomate">open source</a>. Feel free to use the code to make you own timer app to be on one of the slides in the next keynote.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
<p>When I find time I want to add watch support to Fojusi. But I want to use watchOS 2 for this. So I need to watch some WWDC videos first.</p>
<p>Ping me at Twitter or App.net if you have comments about this post or Fojusi.</p>
