I"Î<p>Iâ€™m often working on projects from other devs.
Some of the projects are quite complicated and I have difficulties to remember all the view controllers.
Here is a breakpoint that helps me a lot when figuring out whatâ€™s going on and where I need to fix a bug.</p>

<p>The breakpoint prints the class name of the current view controller to the console.
Itâ€™s a symbolic breakpoint on <code class="highlighter-rouge">-[UIViewController viewDidAppear:]</code> with the debugger command <code class="highlighter-rouge">po $arg1</code>.</p>

<p>To have the breakpoint in all projects, move it to the User.
This can be done by Crl click on the breakpoint and selecting <em>Move Breakpoint To / User</em>.</p>
