I"J<p>Let’s say you have three subviews in a view. Two subviews at the top and
the third one below. The views at the top can have different heights and
it’s not clear which one is taller. Now we want to have the Auto Layout
to manage that the distance of the view at the bottom to the views at
the top is at least 10 points.</p>
