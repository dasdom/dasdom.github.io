I"µ<p>There is this new site <a href="http://github-awards.com/">github-awards.com</a>
that analyzes a github account and rates it according the number of
stars its repositories got. According to that site, <a href="http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=dasdom">my Swift
ranking</a>
<strong>worldwide</strong> is 56. Holy shit! <strong>56!</strong></p>

<p>(Sure, there are repositories that are separated into their one account,
like <a href="https://github.com/Moya/Moya">Moya</a> that is done by <a href="http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=ashfurrow">Ash
Furrow</a>. Keep
that in mind when browsing this site.)</p>

<p>I am totally flashed about this. The main reason is
<a href="https://github.com/dasdom/BreakOutToRefresh">BreakOutToRefresh</a> but
still: Holy shit!</p>

<p>If you have starred one of my repositories, thank you very much!</p>
