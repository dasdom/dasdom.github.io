I"Š<p>When you create a new project in Xcode, it comes with a storyboard. The storyboard handles a few things necessary to bring the initial view controller on screen. In the view debugger a plain Single View Application looks like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/2018-09-17/01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So there is a window, a view controller and a view. The window contains the view controller and the view controller contains the view. So the storyboard (or the code that loads it) is responsible to create a window and set the root view controller. But why is there a window at all? Couldnâ€™t we just put a view controller on screen?</p>

<p>The answer can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/TheAppLifeCycle/TheAppLifeCycle.html">in the documentation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to hosting views, windows work with the UIApplication object to deliver events to your views and view controllers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means, when we want to build our app without using Interface Builder, we need to provide a window and set the root view controller. Letâ€™s do exactly that. Create a new project using the Single View Application template.  I call the project SimpleApp but you sure find a better name. :)</p>

<p>First, remove the storyboard in the project navigator. Then remove the name of the storyboard in the General tab of the target settings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/2018-09-17/02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have now completely removed the storyboard from the project. When we build and run and inspect the app again in the view debugger nothing is shown. There is nothing to see here.</p>

<p>So we need a window. In <code class="highlighter-rouge">AppDelegate</code> there is already a property for the window:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">window</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIWindow</span><span class="p">?</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But it is not set to anything. Before we removed the storyboard, it was set when the storyboard was loaded. Initialising the window is easy. <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIWindow</code> is a subclass of <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIView</code>. This means it can be initialised like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">window</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIWindow</span><span class="p">?</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">UIWindow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">frame</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIScreen</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bounds</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next we need to set the root view controller. The perfect place to do this is <code class="highlighter-rouge">application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_</span> <span class="nv">application</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIApplication</span><span class="p">,</span>
                 <span class="n">didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</span> <span class="nv">launchOptions</span><span class="p">:</span> 
                     <span class="p">[</span><span class="kt">UIApplication</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">LaunchOptionsKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Any</span><span class="p">]?)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Bool</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                     
    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rootViewController</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">ViewController</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">?</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">makeKeyAndVisible</span><span class="p">()</span>
    
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There is an additional line: <code class="highlighter-rouge">window?.makeKeyAndVisible()</code>. With this call we tell UIKit that this window has to be made visible and that it is the key window. The key window of an application receives keyboard and other non-touch events.</p>

<p>We are nearly finished. There is only one thing left to do. If we build and run the app in the current state again the view debugger shows that the view of the view controller is transparent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/2018-09-17/03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reason is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.clear</code> is the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">backgroundColor</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIView</code>s. But when we add a view controller to a storyboard, the background color of the view in the view controller is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.white</code>.</p>

<p>As we have removed the storyboard from the project, we need to set it ourselves. For now a good place for that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">viewDidLoad()</code> in the view controller:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="k">override</span> <span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">viewDidLoad</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">viewDidLoad</span><span class="p">()</span>
    
    <span class="n">view</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">backgroundColor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">UIColor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">white</span>
<span class="p">}</span>   </code></pre></figure>

<p>Done! We have successfully removed the storyboard from the project. Itâ€™s not that hard, isnâ€™t it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the Storyboard</li>
  <li>Delete a string in the settings</li>
  <li>Add four lines of code</li>
</ul>

<p>And we are good to go.</p>
