I"h<p>I started iOS development in 2009 because I wanted to have a physics formula collection for my iPod touch. I searched the App Store for such an App but there where only unusable apps which basically had a series of scann images from formula collections from books.</p>
<p>So I learned Objective-C and the iPhone OS SDK (this was the name of the iOS SDK back then because there was no iPad yet). Half a year later I had the first version of [Phy](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/phy-physics-formulas-calculator/id325836855?l=en&amp;mt=8) in the App Store. I was bad. Really bad but it worked and was still the best physics formula collection back then. I used it a lot because I was physics teacher in an university at that time.</p>
<p>Over the years it became a quite good app with really bad and hardly maintainable code. I basically used an example from the book I used to learn development from and expanded it more or less without really knowing what I was doing.</p>
<p>In the past years I started several times to rewrite it from scratch but every time I found something more interesting on the way and abandoned the update. Now is again the time to try an update.</p>
<p>To keep me interested in the project I have to find things which are new and exciting. Therefore I will use Swift (a programming language I'm still trying to learn) and [Realm](http://realm.io) (a database design especially for the use in mobile devices).</p>
<p>And to increase the pressure to finish the update I will start an update diary here on my blog. So stay tuned for the small steps and the success and failure on the way to the update of Phy.</p>
