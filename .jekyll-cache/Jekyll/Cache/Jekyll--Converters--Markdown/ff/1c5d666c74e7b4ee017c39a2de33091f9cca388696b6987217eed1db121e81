I"M<p>Today I worked on the tests for my new App. The App is developed using Test Driven Development (TDD). I needed a method which converts decimal numbers into fraction numbers. So with an input of 1.5 the method should give the output 1 ½.</p>
<p>First I tried to make that method as general as possible. I though about, how to convert something like 0.3. But one important think one has to remember in TDD:</p>
<p><em>Only implement code you need to pass the test.</em></p>
<p>This is better known as <em>You ain't gonna need it.</em> (YAGNI) It turned out that I only needed fractional numbers with precision of ¼. So the only numbers I had to cover have been 0, ¼, ½, ¾, 1, ...</p>
<p>This could be done with a simple if-else-if statement.</p>
<p>This was very simple. The principle "You ain't gonna need it" saved me a lot of time.</p>
