I"|<p>As you all know <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSCoding</code> doesnâ€™t
work with Swift structs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSCoding</code> only works
for classes inheriting from <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSObject</code>. But the
next (or current) big thing are structs. Value types all the way. So we
need a way to archive and unarchive instances of structs.</p>
