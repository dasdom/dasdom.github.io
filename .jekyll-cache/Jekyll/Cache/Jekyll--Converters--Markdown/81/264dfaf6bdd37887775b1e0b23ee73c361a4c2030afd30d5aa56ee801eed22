I"Q<p>I use Xcode tabs to be faster in switching contexts. Right now I have in all my projects 4 tabs (plus one tab when I'm using Interface Builder in the project).</p>

<p>The tabs are</p>
<p>- Main: This is used for coding. I try to hide the project navigator and use Cmd-â‡§-o to open files I want to edit directly without using the trackpad.<br />
- Tests: Here I write the tests. Like in Main, the project navigator is hidden.<br />
- Testing: In this tab I run the tests. On the left side the test navigator is shown.<br />
- Log: This tab shows the log during building. I anything goes wrong I can just go there and figure out what happened.<br />
- Debug: During debug I use this tab to see the debug logs and the breakpoints.<br />
- IB: In this tab I do the interface building stuff. On the left side the project navigator is open with a filter to only show Interface Builder files (.storyboard, .xib).</p>
<p>In addition I have added Behaviors to switch to the different tabs in different contexts. How this can be achieved will be shown in another post.</p>
