Let's see what options we have as developers.</p><h2>Color Literals</h2><p>Color literals are a feature of Xcode that lets you define the color in a small rectangular box like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/color_literal_autocompletion.png"/><p>The first suggestion in the auto completion by Xcode lets you add a color literal at the cursor position. Subsequently Xcode shows a small square with the preview of that color:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/color_literal_color_selector.png"/><p>If you have worked with colors in Xcode before, this looks a bit strange as it differs from the system color selector you see usually:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/system_color_picker.png"/><p>I think the reason for this is that the color picker you get when using a color literal originated in the Swift Playground app on the iPad. The iPad didn't have a system color picker back then so Apple implemented a new on and reused in in Xcode on the Mac. (Please let me know if there is another reason for this.)</p><p>You get the system color picker when you click the Other button at the bottom of the picker.</p><p>After you have selected a color, the color literal square changes to that color. But what if you have to switch to common UIColor init because of coding guidelines or your Android colleagues need to know the values of the color to use it in the Android version? An easy trick to see the values is to comment out the line with the color literal:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">//    drawViewController.view.tintColor = #colorLiteral(red: 0.9529411793, green: 0.6862745285, blue: 0.1333333403, alpha: 1)</span>
</code></pre><p>The color literal is defined using <code>#colorLiteral(red:green:blue:alpha:)</code>. This means you can change the color literal into the definition of a <code>UIColor</code> by replacing <code>#colorLiteral</code> with <code>UIColor</code>. As this can be annoying if you have several color literals you need to change, I added a feature to my Xcode extension <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bazinga-for-xcode/id1503241323?l=en&mt=12">Bazinga</a>:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/bazinga_color_literal_to_uicolor.png"/><p>(If you don't have Bazinga yet but liked to use it, let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom">Twitter</a> and I'll send you a promo code.) As you can see in the screenshot, Bazinga can also translate UIColor definitions into color literals.</p><p>I think, color literals are seldom used. Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom/status/1302151976520757249?s=20">poll on Twitter</a> but this only represents the small group of iOS developers who happen to follow me on Twitter:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/twitter_poll.png"/><h2>Code</h2><p>Of course you can define a color in code since like forever:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> red = <span class="type">UIColor</span>.<span class="property">red</span>

<span class="keyword">let</span> tint: <span class="type">UIColor</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">brown</span>

<span class="keyword">let</span> backgroundColor = <span class="type">UIColor</span>(hue: <span class="number">0.32</span>, saturation: <span class="number">0.84</span>, brightness: <span class="number">0.9</span>, alpha: <span class="number">1</span>)

<span class="keyword">let</span> buttonColor = <span class="type">UIColor</span>(red: <span class="number">0.1</span>, green: <span class="number">0.0</span>, blue: <span class="number">0.5</span>, alpha: <span class="number">1</span>)

<span class="keyword">let</span> gray = <span class="type">UIColor</span>(white: <span class="number">0.96</span>, alpha: <span class="number">1</span>)
</code></pre><h2>Color Sets</h2><p>With iOS 11 Apple introduced color sets to iOS development. You can add a color set by clicking the plus button at the bottom of the asset catalog of your project. To change the color of the color set, select the color and open the attributes inspector:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/color_set_only_universal.png"/><p>As all apps should support dark mode, you can add a different color in the color set for dark mode my selecting Any, Dark for Appearance in the attributes inspector:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/add_dark_mode_color.png"/><p>You can even add different colors for iPad and iPhone, or for when the user has activated the high contrast accessibility feature in their device.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/color_set_with_many_different_colors.png"/><p>And you can even define colors using hex values by selecting "8-bit Hexadecimal" for the Input Method in the attributes inspector:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-08/hexadecial_color.png"/><p>To use the color in your code, initialize a <code>UIColor</code> with the initializer <code>init(named:)</code> like this:</p><pre><code>drawViewController.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">tintColor</span> = <span class="type">UIColor</span>(named: <span class="string">"tint"</span>)
</code></pre><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>You should always use color sets when possible as they allow to easily support different kind of appearances depending on the settings and preferences of the user. They also allow to define colors using hex values which you often get from the designers.</p><p>Do you have comments, additions or suggestions about this post, let me know on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/dasdom">@dasdom</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/scrolling-a-collection-view-with-custom-duration</guid><title>Scrolling A Collection View With Costum Duration Using CADisplayLink</title><description></description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/scrolling-a-collection-view-with-custom-duration</link><pubDate>Tue, 1 Sep 2020 10:19:55 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Scrolling A Collection View With Costum Duration Using CADisplayLink</h1><p>Last week I needed to scroll a collection view animated to its end with a define duration. Should be easy, right? Just set the content offset of the collection view in an animation block like this:</p><pre><code><span class="type">UIViewPropertyAnimator</span>.<span class="call">runningPropertyAnimator</span>(withDuration: <span class="number">1</span>, delay: <span class="number">0</span>, options: .<span class="dotAccess">curveEaseInOut</span>, animations: {
  <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">collectionView</span>.<span class="property">contentOffset</span>.<span class="property">y</span> = <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">maxOffset</span>
}, completion: <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
</code></pre><p>The result looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-01/scrolling_with_animator.gif"/><p>Oh, that was unexpected. It does indeed animate the content offset of the collection view but during the animation the cells aren't rendered. Only the cells visible in the final position are dequeued and setup.</p><p>If we add a print message to <code>collectionView(_:cellForItemAt:)</code> we can see in the debug output that the data source method is only called for the cells visible after the animation has finished:</p><pre><code>indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">0</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">1</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">2</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">3</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">4</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">5</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">6</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">7</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">992</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">993</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">994</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">995</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">996</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">997</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">998</span>
indexPath.<span class="property">row</span>: <span class="number">999</span>
</code></pre><p>To get the collection view to render the cells (to call the data source method), we need to implement the animated scrolling ourselves. We could try to use a timer that is configured to fire 60 times per second and changed the content offset of the collection view in the action of the timer. The problem is, iOS doesn't guarantee the exact timing of a timer and we would have to figure out the refresh rate of the screen our app is running on.</p><p>There is a better solution: CADisplayLink. CADisplayLink is a class that is connected to the refresh mechanism of the screen. It calls a method we define after a frame finished rendering and we can setup the content of the screen accordingly. And it's quite easy to use.</p><h2>Using CADisplayLink</h2><p>First we need to setup the display link:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@objc func</span> scrollDownDisplayLink() {
  <span class="keyword">if</span> displayLink == <span class="keyword">nil</span> {
    displayLink = <span class="type">CADisplayLink</span>(target: <span class="keyword">self</span>, selector: <span class="keyword">#selector</span>(updateScrollPosition))
    displayLink?.<span class="call">add</span>(to: .<span class="dotAccess">current</span>, forMode: .<span class="dotAccess">default</span>)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>In this code we tell the display link that it should call the method <code>updateScrollPosition()</code> after each screen rendering. The method should calculate the new scroll position based on the animation curve and the elapsed time. This is a possible implementation:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@objc func</span> updateScrollPosition() {
  <span class="keyword">guard let</span> displayLink = displayLink <span class="keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="keyword">return</span>
  }
  
  <span class="comment">// get timestamp at start of animation</span>
  <span class="keyword">if</span> startTimestamp &lt; <span class="number">1</span> {
    startTimestamp = displayLink.<span class="property">timestamp</span>
    startOffset = collectionView.<span class="property">contentOffset</span>.<span class="property">y</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span>
  }
  
  <span class="comment">// calculate fraction of animation; 0: start; 1: end</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> fraction = (displayLink.<span class="property">targetTimestamp</span> - startTimestamp) / duration
  <span class="keyword">if</span> fraction &gt; <span class="number">1</span> || previousFraction &gt; fraction {
    <span class="comment">// animation is finished</span>
    displayLink.<span class="call">invalidate</span>()
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">displayLink</span> = <span class="keyword">nil</span>
    startTimestamp = <span class="number">0</span>
    previousFraction = <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="comment">// scroll to final point just to make sure</span>
    collectionView.<span class="call">setContentOffset</span>(<span class="type">CGPoint</span>(x: <span class="number">0</span>, y: maxOffset), animated: <span class="keyword">false</span>)
  } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
    <span class="comment">// calculate offset for this frame of the animation</span>
    <span class="keyword">let</span> offset = (maxOffset - startOffset) * <span class="type">CGFloat</span>(<span class="call">easeInOut</span>(for: fraction)) + startOffset
    collectionView.<span class="property">contentOffset</span>.<span class="property">y</span> = offset
    previousFraction = fraction
  }
}

<span class="comment">// https://stackoverflow.com/a/25730573/498796</span>
<span class="keyword">private func</span> easeInOut(for fraction: <span class="type">Double</span>) -&gt; <span class="type">Double</span> {
  <span class="keyword">return</span> fraction * fraction * (<span class="number">3.0</span> - <span class="number">2.0</span> * fraction)
}
</code></pre><p>In this code, we first figure out if the start time stamp is already set. We need this to calculate the fraction of the animation for the next screen update. Next we calculate this fraction (formula from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25730573/498796">here</a>). If the result is larger than 1 or smaller than the previous fraction, the animation is finished and we invalidate and clean up the display link.</p><p>Otherwise we calculate the new offset using the method <code>easeInOut(for:)</code>. This method takes the time fraction of the animation as a parameter and returns the fraction of the animation. This is how animation curves work. For any given fraction of time of the animation there is a fraction of animation value (in this case scroll offset).</p><p>Using this code the animation looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-09-01/scrolling_with_cadisplaylink.gif"/><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It's a bit unexpected that there is no easy build-in way to scroll a collection view to a desired offset. Maybe there is and I wasn't patient enough to find it. If you know a better way to do this, please let me know.</p><p>Fortunately <code>CADisplayLink</code> is easy to use.</p><p>If you have comments or remarks about this post, let me know on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom">@dasdom</a></p><h2>My Book</h2><p>Are you a beginner in iOS and want to learn something about GPS, maps and sensors while having fun?

One of the easiest of these transitions is taking an element from the previous view and animating it to its new place in the next view. For example like shown in this gif:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-08-18/image_transition.gif"/><p>At the job I had to implement another custom transition where an expanding circular region got punched out of the current view showing the next view beneath it. It took me a while and several wrong path to finally get it working.</p><p>The result looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-08-18/circular_transition.gif"/><p>(In reality the transition is a bit faster. I slowed it down for this gif to make the shadow easier to see.) The first approach we took was to add a circular expanding mask to the next view.</p><h2>First Approach: Expanding Mask</h2><p>Since iOS 8 <code>UIView</code> has a <code>mask</code> property that can be used to mask the shown portion of the view. To use this mask in a transition, we first need a <code>NSObject</code> subclass that conforms to the protocol <code>UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> MaskTransition: <span class="type">NSObject</span>, <span class="type">UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning</span> {
  
  <span class="keyword">let</span> duration: <span class="type">TimeInterval</span> = <span class="number">1</span>
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> transitionDuration(using transitionContext: <span class="type">UIViewControllerContextTransitioning</span>?) -&gt; <span class="type">TimeInterval</span> {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> duration
  }
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> animateTransition(using transitionContext: <span class="type">UIViewControllerContextTransitioning</span>) {
    <span class="comment">// To be implemented</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>We define the transition animation in the method <code>animateTransition(using:)</code>. Within this method we can access the involved view controllers through the <code>transitionContext</code> like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">guard let</span> from = transitionContext.<span class="call">viewController</span>(forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">from</span>),
  <span class="keyword">let</span> to = transitionContext.<span class="call">viewController</span>(forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">to</span>) <span class="keyword">else</span> {
    transitionContext.<span class="call">completeTransition</span>(<span class="keyword">false</span>)
    <span class="keyword">return</span>
}
</code></pre><p>The transition itself happens in a container view. We have to add the views that should be visible during the transition to that container view:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> containerView = transitionContext.<span class="property">containerView</span>

containerView.<span class="call">addSubview</span>(from.<span class="property">view</span>)
containerView.<span class="call">addSubview</span>(to.<span class="property">view</span>)
</code></pre><p>Next we define the start and the end radius of the view mask:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> fromRadius: <span class="type">CGFloat</span> = <span class="number">4</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> toRadius: <span class="type">CGFloat</span> = containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>.<span class="property">size</span>.<span class="property">height</span> * <span class="number">1.2</span>
</code></pre><p>We define the view to be used as the mask view and add it to the view we are transition to:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> maskView = <span class="type">UIView</span>(frame: <span class="type">CGRect</span>(x: <span class="number">0</span>, y: <span class="number">0</span>,
                                    width: fromRadius, height: fromRadius))
maskView.<span class="property">backgroundColor</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">white</span>
maskView.<span class="property">center</span> = containerView.<span class="property">center</span>
maskView.<span class="property">layer</span>.<span class="property">cornerRadius</span> = fromRadius/<span class="number">2</span>

to.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">mask</span> = maskView
</code></pre><p>Note that we set the <code>backgroundColor</code> of the mask view to <code>.white</code> here. As this view is used as a mask, only the alpha value of that background color is used. So you could also set the color to any other color as long as its alpha value is <code>1</code>.</p><p>Finally we can animate the transition like this:</p><pre><code><span class="type">UIViewPropertyAnimator</span>.<span class="call">runningPropertyAnimator</span>(
  withDuration: duration, delay: <span class="number">0</span>, options: .<span class="dotAccess">curveEaseIn</span>, animations: {
    
    maskView.<span class="property">frame</span> = <span class="type">CGRect</span>(x: <span class="number">0</span>, y: <span class="number">0</span>, width: toRadius, height: toRadius)
    maskView.<span class="property">center</span> = containerView.<span class="property">center</span>
    maskView.<span class="property">layer</span>.<span class="property">cornerRadius</span> = toRadius/<span class="number">2</span>
    
}) { position <span class="keyword">in</span>
  
  to.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">mask</span> = <span class="keyword">nil
  let</span> complete = !transitionContext.<span class="property">transitionWasCancelled</span>
  transitionContext.<span class="call">completeTransition</span>(complete)
  
}
</code></pre><p>When the animation is finished, we need to tell the transition context that the transition is complete. Don't forget this step otherwise the transition never finishes and the user interface stays unresponsive.</p><p>To use this transition when a view controller gets pushed onto the navigation stack, create a class called <code>NavigationControllerDelegate</code> and add the following code:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> NavigationControllerDelegate: <span class="type">NSObject</span>, <span class="type">UINavigationControllerDelegate</span> {
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> navigationController(<span class="keyword">_</span> navigationController: <span class="type">UINavigationController</span>,
                            animationControllerFor operation: <span class="type">UINavigationController</span>.<span class="type">Operation</span>, 
                            from fromVC: <span class="type">UIViewController</span>, 
                            to toVC: <span class="type">UIViewController</span>) -&gt; <span class="type">UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning</span>? {
    
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="type">MaskTransition</span>()
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Finally we need to set the delegate to the navigation controller we are using. You can do that where ever it fits in your code. As I'm creating the user interface in code, a good place to set the navigation controller delegate is the scene delegate where I create the navigation controller:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> navigationControllerDelegate = <span class="type">NavigationControllerDelegate</span>()

<span class="keyword">func</span> scene(<span class="keyword">_</span> scene: <span class="type">UIScene</span>,
           willConnectTo session: <span class="type">UISceneSession</span>,
           options connectionOptions: <span class="type">UIScene</span>.<span class="type">ConnectionOptions</span>) {
  
  <span class="keyword">guard let</span> scene = (scene <span class="keyword">as</span>? <span class="type">UIWindowScene</span>) <span class="keyword">else</span> { <span class="keyword">return</span> }
  
  window = <span class="type">UIWindow</span>(windowScene: scene)
  <span class="keyword">let</span> navigationController = <span class="type">UINavigationController</span>(rootViewController: <span class="type">ViewController</span>())
  navigationController.<span class="property">delegate</span> = navigationControllerDelegate
  window?.<span class="property">rootViewController</span> = navigationController
  window?.<span class="call">makeKeyAndVisible</span>()
}
</code></pre><p>This transition looks kind of what we try to achieve but one essential part is missing: the shadow. There should be a shadow indicating that this is a punch out in the current view, revealing the next view underneath it. I tried everything I could imagine but I didn't manage to add this shadow. This is not really surprising as we do not punch out anything here. So to make the transition as required, we have to actually punch out a portion of the view.</p><p>(If you don't need the shadow, you can use this transition because it's simpler than the following one.)</p><h2>Punch Out With Shadow</h2><p>First let's recreate the transition we did with the mask view but this time punching out instead of masking. The start of <code>animateTransition(using:)</code> looks the same:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> animateTransition(using transitionContext: <span class="type">UIViewControllerContextTransitioning</span>) {
  
  <span class="keyword">guard let</span> from = transitionContext.<span class="call">viewController</span>(forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">from</span>),
    <span class="keyword">let</span> to = transitionContext.<span class="call">viewController</span>(forKey: .<span class="dotAccess">to</span>) <span class="keyword">else</span> {
      transitionContext.<span class="call">completeTransition</span>(<span class="keyword">false</span>)
      <span class="keyword">return</span>
  }
  
  <span class="keyword">let</span> containerView = transitionContext.<span class="property">containerView</span>
  containerView.<span class="call">addSubview</span>(to.<span class="property">view</span>)
  containerView.<span class="call">addSubview</span>(from.<span class="property">view</span>)
  
  <span class="keyword">let</span> fromWidth: <span class="type">CGFloat</span> = <span class="number">4</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> toWidth = containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>.<span class="property">size</span>.<span class="property">height</span> * <span class="number">1.2</span>
  
  <span class="comment">// More code...</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Instead of masking, we define a <code>UIBezierPath</code> consisting of a rectangle around the container view and small circular path in the center:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> center = containerView.<span class="property">center</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> fromPath = <span class="type">UIBezierPath</span>(rect: containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> fromRect = <span class="type">CGRect</span>(x: center.<span class="property">x</span> - fromWidth/<span class="number">2</span>, y: center.<span class="property">y</span> - fromWidth/<span class="number">2</span>, width: fromWidth, height: fromWidth)
<span class="keyword">let</span> maskFromPath = <span class="type">UIBezierPath</span>(ovalIn: fromRect)
fromPath.<span class="call">append</span>(maskFromPath)
</code></pre><p>In the same way we define a <code>UIBezierPath</code> with a larger frame and a much larger circular path:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> toPath = <span class="type">UIBezierPath</span>(rect: containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>.<span class="call">insetBy</span>(dx: -<span class="number">40</span>, dy: -<span class="number">40</span>))
<span class="keyword">let</span> toRect = <span class="type">CGRect</span>(x: center.<span class="property">x</span> - toWidth/<span class="number">2</span>, y: center.<span class="property">y</span> - toWidth/<span class="number">2</span>, width: toWidth, height: toWidth)
<span class="keyword">let</span> maskToPath = <span class="type">UIBezierPath</span>(ovalIn: toRect)
toPath.<span class="call">append</span>(maskToPath)
</code></pre><p>Next we need two layers; one for the mask and one for the shadow:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> maskLayer = <span class="type">CAShapeLayer</span>()
maskLayer.<span class="property">frame</span> = containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>
maskLayer.<span class="property">fillRule</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">evenOdd</span>
maskLayer.<span class="property">path</span> = fromPath.<span class="property">cgPath</span>
from.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">layer</span>.<span class="property">mask</span> = maskLayer

<span class="keyword">let</span> shadowLayer = <span class="type">CAShapeLayer</span>()
shadowLayer.<span class="property">frame</span> = containerView.<span class="property">bounds</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">fillRule</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">evenOdd</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">shadowColor</span> = <span class="type">UIColor</span>.<span class="property">black</span>.<span class="property">cgColor</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">shadowOpacity</span> = <span class="number">1</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">shadowRadius</span> = <span class="number">6</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">shadowOffset</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">zero</span>
shadowLayer.<span class="property">path</span> = fromPath.<span class="property">cgPath</span>
from.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">superview</span>!.layer.<span class="call">insertSublayer</span>(shadowLayer, below: from.<span class="property">view</span>.<span class="property">layer</span>)
</code></pre><p>We have to use the <code>.evenOdd</code> fill rule because other wise the circular path is not punched out. The mask layer is used as the mask of the layer of the <code>from.view</code> like we did in the previous section with the mask view.</p><p>The shape layer is inserted in the layer tree underneath the layer of the <code>from.view</code>. It has the same path and also uses the <code>.evenOdd</code> fill rule.</p><p><code>UIViewPropertyAnimator</code> cannot animate layer properties. We have to fall back to <code>CABasicAnimation</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="type">CATransaction</span>.<span class="call">begin</span>()
<span class="type">CATransaction</span>.<span class="call">setCompletionBlock</span> {

<span class="type">CATransaction</span>.<span class="call">commit</span>()
</code></pre><p>The <code>CATransaction</code> let's us define a completion block that gets executed when the animation has finished. In the completion block we remove the layers and complete the transition.</p><p>That's it. We can now add a cool punch out circular transition between view controllers.</p><h2>The Pop Transition</h2><p>The code we have written only manages the push transition.

Or I need to simulate events like discovery of iBeacons without having the iBeacons around. Or I need to test the look of the view with different data.</p><p>To make this and much more easy during development I often add a development menu to the app. When I long press the screen a menu appears that lets me switch to another part of the app or simulate events.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-08-11/dev-menu.png"/><p>Here is how this can easily be added your you UIKit app.</p><p>In this example implementation we want to be able to navigate to an arbitrary view controller and to send notifications via the <code>NotificationCenter</code>. Notifications can be used to trigger arbitrary actions in the apps and they are easy to remove when development is 'finished'. We define the type of the developer actions in the developer menu using an enum:</p><h2>Developer Menu Item</h2><pre><code><span class="keyword">enum</span> DevActionType {
  <span class="keyword">case</span> viewController
  <span class="keyword">case</span> notification
}
</code></pre><p>The structure holding the information about the developer menu item looks like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> DevAction {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> name: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> identifier: <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> type: <span class="type">DevActionType</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> userInfo: [<span class="type">AnyHashable</span> : <span class="type">Any</span>]?
  
  <span class="keyword">init</span>(name: <span class="type">String</span>,
       identifier: <span class="type">String</span>,
       type: <span class="type">DevActionType</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">viewController</span>,
       userInfo: [<span class="type">AnyHashable</span> : <span class="type">Any</span>]? = <span class="keyword">nil</span>) {
    
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">name</span> = name
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">identifier</span> = identifier
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">type</span> = type
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">userInfo</span> = userInfo
  }
}
</code></pre><p>The developer action consists of a name to be shown in the user interface, an identifier to define the action, a type, and an optional user info to be used in notifications. Next we need a method that we can call when we want to invoke the action. I think 'trigger' is a good name for this method. We have to pass in the window of the app to be able to replace the root view controller:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> trigger(window: <span class="type">UIWindow</span>? = <span class="keyword">nil</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">switch</span> type {
    <span class="keyword">case</span> .<span class="dotAccess">viewController</span>:
      <span class="comment">// instantiate view controller and set as root</span>
      <span class="keyword">let</span> storyboard = <span class="type">UIStoryboard</span>(name: <span class="string">"Main"</span>, bundle: <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
      <span class="keyword">let</span> viewController = storyboard.<span class="call">instantiateViewController</span>(withIdentifier: identifier)
      window?.<span class="property">rootViewController</span> = viewController

    <span class="keyword">case</span> .<span class="dotAccess">notification</span>:
      <span class="comment">// post notification with identifier as name</span>
      <span class="keyword">let</span> notificationName = <span class="type">Notification</span>.<span class="type">Name</span>(rawValue: identifier)
      <span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">post</span>(name: notificationName,
                                      object: <span class="keyword">self</span>,
                                      userInfo: userInfo)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>If the type of the action is <code>.viewController</code>, we instantiate an instance from the storyboard and set it as the root view controller of the window. If the type of the action is <code>.notification</code>, we post a notification using the identifier as the notification name and the user info.</p><p>With a structure for the developer action, we can setup the user interface for the developer menu. In <code>SceneDelegate.swift</code> we add the following extension:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">SceneDelegate</span> {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> setupDevMenu() {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> devActions = [
      <span class="type">DevAction</span>(name: <span class="string">"Foo"</span>, identifier: <span class="string">"FooViewController"</span>),
      <span class="type">DevAction</span>(name: <span class="string">"Login"</span>, identifier: <span class="string">"LoginViewController"</span>),
      <span class="type">DevAction</span>(name: <span class="string">"Profile"</span>, identifier: <span class="string">"ProfileViewController"</span>),
      <span class="type">DevAction</span>(name: <span class="string">"Name: Dasdom"</span>,
                identifier: <span class="string">"changeName"</span>,
                type: .<span class="dotAccess">notification</span>,
                userInfo: [<span class="string">"name"</span>: <span class="string">"dasdom"</span>])
    ]
    
    <span class="keyword">let</span> sheet = <span class="type">UIAlertController</span>(title: <span class="string">"Dev Menu"</span>,
                                  message: <span class="string">"Where do you wanna go?"</span>,
                                  preferredStyle: .<span class="dotAccess">actionSheet</span>)
    
    <span class="keyword">for</span> devAction <span class="keyword">in</span> devActions {
      <span class="keyword">let</span> action = <span class="type">UIAlertAction</span>(title: devAction.<span class="property">name</span>, style: .<span class="dotAccess">default</span>) { action <span class="keyword">in</span>

    }
    
    sheet.<span class="call">addAction</span>(<span class="type">UIAlertAction</span>(title: <span class="string">"Cancel"</span>, style: .<span class="dotAccess">cancel</span>, handler: <span class="keyword">nil</span>))
    
    window?.<span class="property">rootViewController</span>?.<span class="call">present</span>(sheet, animated: <span class="keyword">true</span>, completion: <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>With this extension we add a method to be called when we want to present the developer menu. In the method we define the developer actions. Next we define a <code>UIAlertController</code> sheet using the developer actions as actions. The action to be executed by the <code>UIAlertController</code> when we select a developer action just calls the trigger method of the developer action. We use the root view controller of the window to present the sheet in the user interface.</p><p>In our example the developer menu consists of four actions. Three to present view controllers and one to post a notification.</p><h2>Presenting The Developer Menu</h2><p>The final piece of the puzzle is to present the developer menu in the user interface. In my <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dhios/">book</a> I show how to use a special shake of the device to trigger a log screen. In this example we use a long press gesture recognizer to trigger the developer menu.</p><p>Fist we add a method that we use as an action for the gesture recognizer. A good place to define this method is the extension of <code>SceneDelegate</code> defined earlier.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@objc func</span> showDevMenu(<span class="keyword">_</span> sender: <span class="type">UIGestureRecognizer</span>) {
  <span class="call">setupDevMenu</span>()
}
</code></pre><p>Next we add the gesture recognizer to the window in <code>scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)</code> of the <code>SceneDelegate</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="preprocessing">#if DEBUG</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> longPressRecognizer = <span class="type">UILongPressGestureRecognizer</span>(target: <span class="keyword">self</span>, action: <span class="keyword">#selector</span>(<span class="call">showDevMenu</span>(<span class="keyword">_</span>:)))
longPressRecognizer.<span class="property">minimumPressDuration</span> = <span class="number">2</span>
window?.<span class="call">addGestureRecognizer</span>(longPressRecognizer)
<span class="preprocessing">#endif</span>
</code></pre><p>It's a good idea to only add the gesture recognizer in DEBUG builds.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In some apps a developer menu can be a real time safer, especially when you have to iterate over one feature or a certain part of the user interface. It is quite easy to add such a developer menu in a way that it's safe and it doesn't affect the rest of the app. We can use notifications to trigger events or to add demo data and wrap this code in <code>#if DEBUG</code> statements.</p><p>What do you think about this approach?

This post explains how to write a unit tests that asserts that the cell is populated correctly.</description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/testing-uicollection_uicollection_view_compositional_layout_list</link><pubDate>Sat, 6 Jun 2020 12:23:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Testing a Custom UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.list</h1><p>In iOS 14 Apple added a collection view compositional layout that lets us create collection views that look and behave like <code>UITableView</code>s. It is based on UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout and as a result allows to create very complex collection view layouts with only little code.</p><p>I believe that we should test our view controllers. For example I often write tests that assure that setting up a table view cell works as intended. An example for such a test looks like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_cellForRow_populatesCell() {
  <span class="comment">// given</span>
  sut.<span class="property">names</span> = [<span class="string">"foo"</span>]
  
  <span class="comment">// when</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> indexPath = <span class="type">IndexPath</span>(row: <span class="number">0</span>, section: <span class="number">0</span>)
  <span class="keyword">let</span> cell = tableView.<span class="property">dataSource</span>?.<span class="call">tableView</span>(tableView, cellForRowAt: indexPath)
  
  <span class="comment">// then</span>
  <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(cell?.<span class="property">textLabel</span>?.<span class="property">text</span>, sut.<span class="property">names</span>.<span class="property">first</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>(This code is taken from my book <a href="https://leanpub.com/tdd_ios_gimme_the_code">Test-Driven iOS Development - Gimme The Code</a>).</p><p>Testing the population of a table view cell is quite easy. We setup the data source, get the cell from it and assert that the relevant data is set to the label in the cell.</p><p>The list layout in <code>UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout</code> works quite differently. I don't want to go into detail in this post how you can setup a collection view with the new list layout. Let's safe that for a later post. All you need to know is that you setup a <code>UICellConfigurationState</code> and tell the cell that it needs to update it's configuration. The cell then calls the method <code>updateConfiguration(using:)</code> and you override that method to setup the cell.</p><p>You can see how this works in <code>CustomCellListViewController.swift</code> in the sample code provided by Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/views_and_controls/collection_views/implementing_modern_collection_views">here</a>.</p><p>When I tried to write a test for this, I ran into the problem that <code>updateConfiguration(using:)</code> is called after my test is finished. <s>So it looks like to me that UIKit postpones the call onto the next run loop. This means to be able to test the population of the collection view cell, I needed move the assertion to the next run loop as well.</s> The Apple engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/_mochs">@_mochs</a> answered to my posts, that it should be sufficient to call <code>layoutIfNeeded</code> on the cell to trigger populating the cell.</p><p>So, this works:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_cellForItem_returnsConfiguresCell() {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> item = <span class="type">Item</span>(category: .<span class="dotAccess">music</span>, title: <span class="string">"Foo"</span>, description: <span class="string">"Bar"</span>)
    sut.<span class="property">items</span> = [item]
    sut.<span class="call">loadViewIfNeeded</span>()

    <span class="keyword">let</span> indexPath = <span class="type">IndexPath</span>(item: <span class="number">0</span>, section: <span class="number">0</span>)
    <span class="keyword">let</span> cell = collectionView.<span class="property">dataSource</span>?.<span class="call">collectionView</span>(collectionView, cellForItemAt: indexPath) <span class="keyword">as</span>! <span class="type">CustomListCell</span>

    <span class="keyword">let</span> listContentConfiguration = cell.<span class="property">listContentView</span>.<span class="property">configuration</span> <span class="keyword">as</span>! <span class="type">UIListContentConfiguration</span>
    <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(listContentConfiguration.<span class="property">text</span>, item.<span class="property">title</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>By the way, this is a test for the sample code provided by Apple. I've added tests to better understand what's going on.</p><p>Do you know a better way to test this? How would you test that the collection view cell in the list layout is populated properly?</p><p>If you have questions or remarks about this post, please let me know on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom">@dasdom</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/using-tabs-in-xcode</guid><title>Using Tabs in Xcode</title><description>Tabs in Xcode can be quite useful.

I use them a lot.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-25/my_tabs_in_xcode.png"/><p>Usually I have a tab for coding (🤓), one for the files with a source control status (🗂), a tab for searching (🔍), a tab for debugging (🐞) and one for the build (💾).</p><h2>🤓 Coding</h2><p>The coding tab shows the project navigator with all files. Usually there is no inspector visible in the coding tab because most of the times I do my user interfaces in code.</p><h2>🗂 Source Control Status</h2><p>The source control status tab shows the project navigator with the source control status filter active.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-25/source_control_status_tab.png"/><p>This tab is useful when I need to figure out what I have changed since the last commit and if I need to revert a change I did while debugging.</p><h2>🔍 Search</h2><p>This tab shows the find navigator. This tab is useful when I need to find usages of a class or a method but want to keep track of the file I working on right now in the coding tab.</p><h2>🐞 Debug</h2><p>I have set up a behavior such that Xcode switches to the debug tab when running starts. The behavior automatically selects the debug navigator and shows the variable and console view of the debugger. This way Xcode shows all the information I need to debug problems when they occur.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-25/running_starts_behavior.png"/><h2>💾 Build</h2><p>The build tab used to show the log of the build. I have a behavior that show the build log when the build starts. Unfortunately Apple broke that behavior with Xcode 10 and still haven't fixed it (FB7675730). As long as the behavior is broken, this tab shows the report navigator and I can select the build log myself if I need to.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-25/build_tab.png"/><h2>Bookmarks</h2><p>In addition to that I also use tabs when I navigate through code I don't know or understand to keep track of important classes.

The interface builder shows you the distance in points between the two view like shown in the following image:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-17/distance_in_interface_builder.png"/><p>But this is the distance between the label and the image view.

Check the check box at 'Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom' and select a modifier key. I use the control key:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-17/accessibility_zoom_setting.png"/><p>When you now press and hold that modifier key and perform a scroll gesture on your track pad or using the mouse, the screen zooms.

The following screenshot shows a simplified version of the user interface.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-11/user_interface_with_wrong_spacing.png"/><p>In the storyboard the distance between the image and the label was defined as 10 points as you can see in the following screenshot:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-11/space_constraint_in_interface_builder.png"/><p>But when running the app on the simulator or on a real device the space between the image and the label was much larger than 10 points. To figure out the real distance, I set the window of the simulator to Point Accurate.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-11/point_accurate_setting.png"/><p>With this setting the number of pixels on the Mac display correspond to the points in the user interface. To count the number of pixels, we can scale the Mac display using the zoom accessibility feature or we can use 3rd-party tool. A great tool for such a task is <a href="https://xscopeapp.com">xScope</a>. Using xScope, I measure a distance of 29 points.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-11/real_distance_measured.png"/><p>The real user interface was more complex than that. The image view was a custom <code>UIView</code> subclass defined in a Xib, containing several instances of <code>UIImageView</code>. Because of that complexity and a few other problems in the storyboard, it took me about an hour to finally get the idea to look into the code of the host view. And there I found a line like this:</p><pre><code>imageView.<span class="property">transform</span> = <span class="type">CGAffineTransform</span>(scaleX: <span class="number">0.8</span>, y: <span class="number">0.8</span>)
</code></pre><p>The previous developer working on that code used an <code>CGAffineTransform</code> instead of layout constraints to make the image view smaller. I guess the reason for this decision was, that in the Xib of the composed view, one of the image views had a fixed width. And because of time constraints, using a transform might be the faster solution to his problem.</p><p>To solve the layout problem, I added size constraints to the image view and fixed the constraints in the Xib.</p><p>As a side note, I learned during the investigation that an affine transform on a view changes the frame but not the bounds:</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-11/bounds_not_transformed.png"/><p>That might be common sense and completely obvious to you, but is was new to me. :)</p><p>If you have any comments on that post, you can find my on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom">@dasdom</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/simulate-gps-location-updates-in-simulator</guid><title>Simulating GPS Location Updates in the iOS Simulator</title><description>Add a gpx file to your Xcode project to simulate timed location changes in the iOS simulator.</description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/simulate-gps-location-updates-in-simulator</link><pubDate>Sat, 4 Apr 2020 12:23:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Simulating GPS Location Updates in the iOS Simulator</h1><p>Sometimes when building an iOS app you need to simulate moving around. Let's say, for example, you create an app that allows the users to draw their movement onto a map. It would be difficult to move around with your iOS device connected to Xcode to debug your code.</p><p>Fortunately the iOS simulator can simulate location changes as if the user would do a city run or a free way drive.</p><h2>Simulating a City Run Around Cupertino</h2><p>Build and run your app on the iOS simulator and select the menu item <em>Features / Location / City Run</em>.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-04/simulate_city_run.png"/><p>The simulator delivers location updates as if the device would move during a city run around Cupertino. But sometimes you need more.</p><h2>Simulating a Specific Path</h2><p>If you need to simulate a specific path, you can add a gpx file to the project and select this in Xcode when the app runs in the simulator. Such a gpx file could look like this:</p><pre><code>&lt;?xml version=<span class="string">"1.0"</span>?&gt;
&lt;gpx version=<span class="string">"1.1"</span> creator=<span class="string">"GPXRouteCreator"</span>&gt;
  &lt;wpt lat=<span class="string">"51.24254280000747"</span> lon=<span class="string">"6.769857406333074"</span>&gt;

  &lt;/wpt&gt;
&lt;/gpx&gt;
</code></pre><p>Each point in this gpx file defines a latitude and a longitude and an optional time. When using a gpx file with time values the simulator uses the time difference between those points to simulate the movement. The shorter the time difference between two points is, the faster the simulated movement.</p><p>Add the gpx file to the project and run your app on the simulator. In the debug bar in Xcode click the location icon and select the file you added to the project. In this example here I named the file <code>track.gpx</code>.</p><img src="../../assets/2020-04-04/select_gpx_file.png"/><p>When the simulator reaches the last point in the gpx file, it starts at the beginning again.</p><h2>Creating GPX Files</h2><p>You can write the gpx files you need yourself, or you can use <a href="https://github.com/dasdom/GPXRouteCreator">the open source app</a> I build for my own needs.

</code></pre><p>First we create a <code>DispatchQueue</code>. With this queue we create a <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code>.

Next we add the action that should be executed when the timer fires. Don't forget to call <code>resume()</code> on the timer.</p><p>To invalidate the timer call <code>cancel()</code> on it.</p><p>That's it.

Now I try to make it the best formulary app in the App Store again. The best formulary app in 2019 needs to support dynamic type.</p><p>One of the main features of my formulary app is the calculator. For the update I rewrote the UI from scratch using <code>UIButton</code>s and <code>UIStackView</code>s. For the next update I wanted the calculator to support dynamic type. But the naïve approach didn't work.</p><h1>The Naïve Approach</h1><p><code>UIButton</code> has a <code>UILabel</code> subview to hold the title. To set the font of the button you need to set the font of that label.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> button = <span class="type">UIButton</span>(type: .<span class="dotAccess">system</span>)

button.<span class="property">titleLabel</span>?.<span class="property">adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory</span> = <span class="keyword">true</span>
</code></pre><p>The last line tells UIKit that the font should be changed whenever the user changes the text size in settings or from Control Center. If the font is changed from small to huge while the app is running, the result looks like this (I added a border around the label for clarification):</p><img src="../../assets/2019-08-09/button_font_small.png" alt="Before the font change"/><img src="../../assets/2019-08-09/button_font_huge.png" alt="After the font change"/><p>So this doesn't work.</p><p>To make dynamic type work in a UIButton, I needed to add a strange hack to a UIButton subclass.</p><h1>Custom Subclass</h1><p>The resizing of the title label works if I use a subclass of <code>UIButton</code> that looks like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@implementation</span> <span class="type">CalculatorButton</span>

This changed my life.</p><p>At the time I worked at the university as a physics teacher. And I needed a physics formulary on my new iPod touch. There is an app for that, right? There had been formulary apps in the App Store. But they didn't fit my needs. So I tried to build my own.</p><p>Back in the days apps had been written in Objective-C (ObjC). So I tried to learn ObjC and failed. A few month later I met a former colleague who showed me his app in the App Store, a rain radar.</p><p>I thought, if he can do it, <em>I</em> can do it. This time I bought a book about development of iPhoneOS apps. Fortunately an example project in the book was kind of what I liked to build. From that example I hacked the first version of my formulary.</p><p>And with hacked I really mean hacked. The example in the book only had one view controller for a list of items stored in a plist. I needed several lists. So I put all the code for all the lists in that one view controller. This was my first massive view controller. I guess creating a massive view controller is some kind of initiation ceremony.</p><p>Then it was time to put it into the world by submitting it to the App Store. All good names had already been taken and I'm really bad in naming stuff. So I chosed the name Phy. As expected a bad name. :D Strangely enough the app was successful. I made a lot of money from it. At least for my standards. (The best month was about $1500 before taxes.)</p><h1>Changing Careers</h1><p>I loved my job as a physics teacher. But it bugged me that I only could code in my spare time. What if I could write code 8 hours a day and get paid for it. That would be awesome!</p><p>My girlfriend lived in an other city and we finally decided to move in together. I applied for different jobs related to teaching physics but also for a few job offers as iPhoneOS developer.</p><p>Luckily I got an interview with a small agency creating apps for other companies. I proudly showed my formulary in the interview and got the job. Mainly because there was no one else who could write apps for iPhone and iPad. I'm very thankful for this opportunity especially as I know to day how bad my code was at that time.</p><h1>What Happened To Phy</h1><p>Years went by and Phy started to look bad on new iPhones. I tried to rewrite it from scratch several times but lost interest early each and every time. And finally a few years ago I had to pull it from the App Store because of the quality initiative by Apple.</p><p>Last year I decided to try to get it back to the App Store. But this time I used the old and really bad ObjC code. I fixed the bugs I knew of and rewrote some view controllers using ObjC.</p><p>This time I made it! I got Phy into a state where it could be resubmitted to the App Store.</p><h1>The Special App</h1><p>Phy is special for me. It made me a developer. The code was (and partly is) really really bad. But this is not that important. It allowed me to become an iOS developer. Today I'm able to support my family by coding ObjC and Swift. That is awesome!</p><h1>What I Learn From The Update</h1><p>Nice and clean code doesn't count much if you don't finish it. Sometimes it's easier to work with what you have. Bad working ObjC code is better than Swift 2 code not compiling anymore because it's older than 2 years.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/testing-presentation-of-a-view-controller</guid><title>Testing The Presentation Of A View Controller</title><description>It's quite easy to test if a view controller is presented on screen after some action. Here is how this works.</description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/testing-presentation-of-a-view-controller</link><pubDate>Tue, 2 Apr 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Testing The Presentation Of A View Controller</h1><blockquote><p>I'm writing <a href="https://leanpub.com/tddfakebookforios">a book about Test-Driven iOS Development</a> with Swift. It's not a traditional book, it's mainly only the code. If you are like me and seldom read blog posts but rather skim for the code, this book is for you.</p></blockquote><p>Let's say we need to test if an action triggers the presentation of a view controller. The test looks like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> test_presentationOfViewController() {
  <span class="comment">// Arrange</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> window = <span class="type">UIWindow</span>(frame: <span class="type">CGRect</span>(x: <span class="number">0</span>, y: <span class="number">0</span>, width: <span class="number">300</span>, height: <span class="number">300</span>))
  <span class="comment">// sut == system under test</span>
  window.<span class="property">rootViewController</span> = sut
  window.<span class="call">makeKeyAndVisible</span>()
    
  <span class="comment">// Act</span>
  sut.<span class="call">showNext</span>()
    
  <span class="comment">// Assert</span>
  <span class="call">XCTAssertTrue</span>(sut.<span class="property">presentedViewController</span> <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="type">DetailViewController</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>First we have to set the view controller (<code>sut</code>) that presents the other view controller as the <code>rootViewController</code> of a window. Then we need to make the window the key window. This way, the view of the view controller is added to the view hierarchy. If we miss the step, no other view controller can be presented on top of that view controller.</p><p>Next the presentation is triggered. How this is done, depends on the code under test. For simplicity, I assume that there is a method <code>showNext()</code> that triggers the presentation.</p><p>In the end we assert that the presented view controller has the expected type. Depending on the presented view controller, we could also assert that an expected item (user, point of interest, tweet, etc) has been passed to it.</p><p>That's all. Straight forward. The tricky part is to remember to add the view controller under test as the root view controller to a window and make the window the key window.</p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/dasdom">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/easy-unit-tests-in-ios-development</guid><title>Easy Unit Tests In iOS Development</title><description>Starting with unit tests is not hard. Here are some easy tests you can add to your project right now.</description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/easy-unit-tests-in-ios-development</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Easy Unit Tests In iOS Development</h1><p>Testing is hard. That's why it's not done enough in iOS development. When I ask other developers, many don't write unit tests at all. That's no good. Unit tests are an essential tool to build high quality iOS apps and allow disruptive refactoring without breaking functionalities.</p><p>The main advantages of writing unit tests are: 1. The code becomes refactorable. 2. Testable code usually is better code. So when you are "forced" to write code, your code automatically becomes better. 3. It's less likely to introduce regression into code with a good test coverage. 4. Writing the tests first often makes implementing a new feature easier because you intentionally make very small steps. 5. Tests are a living documentation. With living I mean, it's less likely that they get asynchronous to the actual code as it often happens to traditional documentation on some website.</p><p>OK, tests are good and important. Let's assume you are willing to start writing tests for your code. How do you start? The most important thing is to write the first test. So here are some easy tests you can introduce to you code right now. Let's get started.</p><h2>Test That A Property Was Set</h2><p>Let's say we have a <code>User</code> struct with a <code>firstname</code> and a <code>lastname</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> User {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> firstname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> lastname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Now we need a property <code>name</code> that is <code>firstname</code> and <code>lastname</code> with space in between.</p><p>We will add that feature using Test-Diven Development (TDD). In TDD you write the test before you add the code to be testet. It sounds strange but after you got used to it, this totally makes sense. We assume the project already has a test target. (If this is not the case, just add a test target.)</p><p>Now the test for the feature we are going to build:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> XCTest
<span class="keyword">@testable import</span> MyApp

<span class="keyword">class</span> PropertyTests : <span class="type">XCTestCase</span> {
  
  <span class="keyword">var</span> sut: <span class="type">User</span>!
  
  <span class="keyword">override func</span> setUp() {
    sut = <span class="type">User</span>()
  }
  
  <span class="keyword">override func</span> tearDown() {
    sut = <span class="keyword">nil</span>
  }
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> test_name_property() {
    <span class="comment">// Arrange

    // Act</span>
    sut.<span class="property">firstname</span> = <span class="string">"Foo"</span>
    sut.<span class="property">lastname</span> = <span class="string">"Bar"</span>
    
    <span class="comment">// Assert</span>
    <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(sut.<span class="property">name</span>, <span class="string">"Foo Bar"</span>)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Try running the test with the shortcut ⌘U. The test does not compile because <code>User</code> doesn't have a property named <code>name</code>. A not compiling test is a failing test. Let's add enough code to make it compile.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> User {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> firstname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> lastname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> name: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Again run the test with ⌘U. Now the test compiles but if fails. This is a good sign because we haven't implemented the code we like to test. If the test would pass before we have implemented the feature, probably the test would pass all the time and would therefore be useless.</p><p>When we change the <code>User</code> struct to the following the test passes:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> User {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> firstname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span> {
    <span class="keyword">didSet</span> {
      <span class="call">updateName</span>(firstname: firstname,
                 lastname: lastname)
    }
  }
  <span class="keyword">var</span> lastname: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span> {
    <span class="keyword">didSet</span> {
      <span class="call">updateName</span>(firstname: firstname,
                 lastname: lastname)
    }
  }
  <span class="keyword">var</span> name: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
  
  <span class="keyword">private mutating func</span> updateName(firstname: <span class="type">String</span>, lastname: <span class="type">String</span>) {
    
    name = <span class="string">"</span>\(firstname) \(lastname)<span class="string">"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>If you run the test again, you'll see that it now passes. Awesome! We just used Test-Driven Development to add a feature to the <code>User</code> struct.</p><p>If you want to learn more about TDD and how to test many different scenarios in iOS development, I'm writing a book about that. It's still im progress, but you can already get it at <a href="https://leanpub.com/tddfakebookforios">leanpub</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/uistackviewplayground</guid><title>UIStackViewPlayground</title><description>UIStackViews are quite powerful.

And this conference was <a href="https://swiftconf.com/">SwiftConf</a>. I do sketch notes to keep concentrated while listening. I'm not good at this but nevertheless it helps me a lot to recall the talk later.</p><p>And it's a good way to give feedback to the speaker.</p><h1>Day 1</h1><h2>Keynote – Stabilizing your ABI</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dimsumthinking">Daniel Steinberg</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The focus of Swift 5 is ABI stabilization. This is a big moment in the evolution of this language we depend so much on. We begin this year’s Swift Conf with a look at what ABI Stabilization means in the life of the Swift Programming Language and what it could mean in your life.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/01.jpg"/><hr><hr><h2>Always Give 100%</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/KubaTurek">Jakub Turek</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The talk is about unit testing and developing iOS apps in TDD with Swift. It will cover a plethora of tips and techniques that me and the team has discovered en route to the app with 200K lines of Swift at nearly 100% code coverage. The talk will highlight the techniques of structuring the code so that it is easily testable. It will demonstrate how to overcome common pain points, such as testing view controllers or the test-first approach for views built entirely in code. It will also show how to refactor the test code for better readability, for example using Sourcery code generation tool. It doesn't matter whether you have never written a single test case or are a veteran looking to push the testing to the limit. If you are like me and want the days of debugging through piles of unmaintainable code to be over, this talk is definitely for you!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/02.jpg"/><hr><hr><h2>The importance of Privacy in iOS</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stuffmc">Manuel “Stuff” Carrasco Molina</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>A lot of time Privacy of my data as a user is not a priority for Developers. Wether it’s my calendar, my contacts, my location, I want as a user to be able to use an app without all of those attacks in my privacy. I want to summarize some things an iOS developer should do to ensure the most critical user can still use my app in some regards, and not just say “I need all your information” like on other platforms. This is the beauty of iOS, being able to fine grained (although not enough) so let’s do this all together, as a beautiful community concerned by Privacy.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/03.jpg"/><hr><hr><h2>Developer experience</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/igrekde">Egor Tolstoy</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Problem validation, roadmaps, usage metrics and feedback, user experience are not first-class citizens in internal platforms and tools development. I'll talk about developer experience, an approach that helps our engineers create useful, thriving and developer-oriented technical products.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/04.jpg"/><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/etolstoy/developer-experience-the-art-of-building-spaceships"><strong>Slides</strong></a></p><hr><hr><h2>Server-side swift without the servers?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/stawecki">Mateusz Stawecki</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Function as a service (FaaS) a.k.a. the mysterious “Serverless” is the latest frontier for cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud. It promises to run your backend Swift code without having to worry about infrastructure or server maintenance. But what about your existing Kitura/Vapor applications? In this talk we’ll explore running Swift in the cloud without having to provision servers or containers. How Serverless can allow us to focus on doing what we love - writing Swift code - and sleep better at night without worrying about server uptime.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/05.jpg"/><hr><hr><h1>Day 2</h1><h2>RxSwift: debunking the myth of hard</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/freak4pc">Shai Mishali</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>RxSwift has been one of the most prominent and upcoming frameworks in the iOS &amp; Swift community in the past years. Its usage is becoming widespread and popular with many companies moving their code base to the Reactive world across iOS, Android, Web and Backend - making it a valuable skill to comprehend. Along with that fact thought, it seems the learning curve for RxSwift and Rx in general always seems "hard" to most people, or too hard to get started with. In this lecture I hope to debunk the myth and misconception of RxSwift being a hard concept, and put developers on the right path to start building Reactive Mobile applications for the modern world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/06.jpg"/><hr><hr><h2>Same language, different platform - searching for synergy between iOS and Vapor</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steffendsommer">Steffen Sommer</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Being able to share code between an iOS app and a backend running server-side Swift was one of the first things I thought about when Swift went open source. It’s been a common argument for choosing a server-side Swift framework ever since, although there’s been little focus on what is actually possible. With this talk I will dive into the current possibilities and limitations for sharing code between iOS and Vapor and I will look ahead and discus how this might change in the future.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sketch notes:</strong></p><img src="../../assets/2018-09-24/07.jpg"/><hr><hr><h2>Mastering iOS Animation</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws">Paul Hudson</a></p><p><strong>Teaser on SwiftConf.com:</strong></p><blockquote><p>We all know that animations help your apps look better, but they also help your readers understand what's changing in your app and why.

Depending on the contents and the background color of the views this is not always easy.</p><p>I the past I usually changed the background color of some views and recompiled the app to see the frames of the views in the simulator. But this approach has several disadvantages.</p><p>First I needed to change the code just to be able to visually debug my layout. Second I needed to stop the debugging session and recompile to make the change visible in the simulator.</p><p>Then I saw the great WWDC session <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/412/">Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB</a> and thought, LLDB might have some tricks to make this process easier. And indeed it does.</p><p>Let's assume we have a login in our app. That might look like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-08-17/01.png" alt="Login screen"/><p>In the debug navigator in the lower left corner is a plus button. If you click it, you can add breakpoints. Add a symbolic breakpoint with the trigger <code>-[UIView didAddSubview:]</code> and add a the Debugger Command:</p><pre><code>e [(<span class="type">UIView</span> *)$arg3 setBackgroundColor:[<span class="type">UIColor</span> colorWithHue:($arg3 % <span class="number">100</span>)/<span class="number">100.0</span> saturation:<span class="number">1.0</span> brightness:<span class="number">1.0</span> alpha:<span class="number">0.5</span>]]
</code></pre><p>In Xcode 9 the UI looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-08-17/02.png" alt="Adding breakpoint in Xcode"/><p>If you now navigate to the login screen, you see something like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-08-17/03.png" alt="Colorful debug screen"/><p>If you geht an error like 'no known method […]', add the Debugger Command at the top <code>e @import UIKit</code> (thanks Byaruhanga Franklin):</p><img src="../../assets/2018-08-17/04.png" alt="Import UIKit"/><p>That's ... interesting.</p><p>Maybe that is to much and you just want to add a border to each view. Then change the Debugger Command to:</p><pre><code>e [[(<span class="type">UIView</span> *)$arg3 layer] setBorderColor:[[<span class="type">UIColor</span> magentaColor] <span class="type">CGColor</span>]]; [[(<span class="type">UIView</span> *)$arg3 layer] setBorderWidth:<span class="number">1</span>];
</code></pre><p>If you navigate to the login screen, you should see something like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-08-17/05.png" alt="Debug screen with borders"/><p>Nice! So with these breakpoints you can always visually check the frames of you views without recompiling the app. You can even go one essential step further. You make these breakpoints available in all your projects by ctr-clicking on each breakpoint and selecting 'Move Breakpoint To &gt; User'.</p><p>If you have so feedback, ping be on <a href="https://twitter.com/dasdom">Twitter</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/snapshot-tests-with-iossnapshottestcase</guid><title>Snapshot tests with iOSSnapshotTestCase</title><description>Use snapshot tests to verify the correctness of your user interface.</description><link>https://dasdom.dev/posts/snapshot-tests-with-iossnapshottestcase</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2018 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Snapshot tests with iOSSnapshotTestCase</h1><p>Sometimes you need to add automatic tests for the UI of your app. There are several different approaches to achieve this.</p><p>In the test you could get the elements of the screen and assert if all the frames are as you expect. Depending on the UI you want to test, this can be a lot of work.</p><p>Or you could use UI tests provided by Xcode. But those are slow and in my experience sometimes they just stop working.</p><p>There is a better alternative. Uber has an open source component called <a href="https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case/">ios-snapshot-test-case</a>. With this you can create snapshot tests. A snapshot test compares the UI of a view with a snapshot of how the view should look like. Let’s see how this works.</p><p>The UI I would like to test looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-07-22/01.png" alt="The screen to be tested"/><p>The UI consists of a label, two text fields and a button.</p><h2>Installing iOSSnapshotTestCase using Carthage</h2><p>I’m a Carthage person. So I will show you how to use Carthage to install <code>iOSSnapshotTestCase</code> in the test target and use it to add a snapshot test for a simple login screen.</p><p>Create a Cartfile that looks like this:</p><pre><code>github <span class="string">"uber/ios-snapshot-test-case"</span>
</code></pre><p>Then ask Carthage to create the dynamic framework with the command</p><pre><code>carthage update --platform iOS
</code></pre><p>Carthage will fetch the source code from github and build the framework. When Carthage is finished, drag the framework from the <code>Carthage/Bild/iOS</code> folder to <strong>Link Binary with Libraries</strong> build phase of you test target:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-07-22/02.png" alt="Add framework"/><p>As you can see, the name of the framework is <code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code> and not iOSSnapshotTestCase. Facebook was the original author of this framework and Uber hasn't manage to change the name yet.</p><p>Next, add a new run script build phase to the test target. Put in the command</p><pre><code>/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
</code></pre><p>and add the Input File <code>$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/FBSnapshotTestCase.framework</code>. In Xcode it should look like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-07-22/03.png" alt="Run script phase"/><h1>Configure FBSnapshotTestCase</h1><p>Next you need to configure the directories where the snapshots should be put. You can also tell <code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code> to create a diff image whenever a snapshot test fails. This means, when a test fails, an image is created that shows the difference between the expected UI and the UI that made the test fail. That way you can figure out what changed in the UI.</p><p>Open the scheme you use of the test and add the following environment variables:</p><pre><code><span class="type">IMAGE_DIFF_DIR</span>: $(<span class="type">SOURCE_ROOT</span>)/$(<span class="type">PROJECT_NAME</span>)<span class="type">Tests</span>/<span class="type">FailureDiffs
FB_REFERENCE_IMAGE_DIR</span>: $(<span class="type">SOURCE_ROOT</span>)/$(<span class="type">PROJECT_NAME</span>)<span class="type">Tests</span>/<span class="type">ReferenceImages</span>
</code></pre><p>In Xcode this looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-07-22/04.png" alt="Environment variables"/><h1>Create the snapshot</h1><p>To create a snapshot test, add a subclass of <code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code> to your test target and add the following import statement:</p><pre><code>#import &lt;<span class="type">FBSnapshotTestCase</span>/<span class="type">FBSnapshotTestCase</span>.<span class="property">h</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>Next add the test method:</p><pre><code>- (void)<span class="call">test_loginSnapshot</span> {
    <span class="type">UIStoryboard</span> *storyboard = [<span class="type">UIStoryboard</span> storyboardWithName:<span class="string">@"Main" bundle:nil];</span>
    <span class="type">UIViewController</span> *viewController = [storyboard instantiateInitialViewController];
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">recordMode</span> = <span class="keyword">true</span>;
    
    [viewController view];
    
    <span class="type">FBSnapshotVerifyView</span>(viewController.<span class="property">view</span>, <span class="keyword">nil</span>);
}
</code></pre><p>The first two lines create an instance of the view controller you want to test. The line <code>self.recoredMode = true;</code> tells the <code>FBSnapshotTestCase</code> that it should create the reference snapshot. The line <code>[viewController view];</code> triggers the loading of the view. This is necessary because otherwise the view is nil in the test. With <code>FBSnapshotVerifyView(viewController.view, nil)</code> the reference snapshot is compared with the current UI of the view.</p><p>Run the test. The test fails but it's not clear why. In Xcode it looks like the test didn't even run. Let's have a look to the log output in the debug console. There is lots and lots of text. If you look closely, there is a hint what's going on:</p><blockquote><p>[...] Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib [...]</p></blockquote><p>So it seems the core lib for Swift isn't loaded. This is strange, because we don't even use Swift in the test or the production code.</p><p>The reason seems to be that the framework iOSSnapshotTestCase has some Swift in it. So we need to tell the compiler that it should load the Swift core lib (and anything else it needs to run Swift). The easies way to do that is to create a Swift test case. Xcode will then ask you if it should create a Bridging Header. Click 'Create Bridging Header'.</p><p>Run the snapshot test again. The test will fail because <code>FBSnapshotVerifyView()</code> doesn't find a reference snapshot to compare the view with. Open the directory of the test target in Finder. There is now a directory <code>ReferenceImages_64</code>. In this directory you can find all the snapshots recored in record mode.</p><p>Now remove the line <code>self.recordMode = true;</code> from the test and run the test again. The test succeeds. Nice! From now on, whenever the UI of the login screen changes you will be notified by a failing test.</p><h1>Diff images</h1><p>But how do we know that the snapshot test really works? Easy, let's change the UI and see what happens. Replace the button title with 'Login'.</p><p>The test fails and there is a new directory with the name <code>FailureDiffs</code> in the directory of the test target. In this new directory you can find all diff images of the failing tests. In my case, the diff image looks like this:</p><img src="../../assets/2018-07-22/05.png"" alt="The diff image"/><p>Awesome! With this image it should be easy to find the change in the UI that made the test fail.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dasdom.dev/posts/sketch-notes-at-uikonf2017</guid><title>Sketch Notes At UIKonf 2017</title><description>Sketch notes help be to stay focused during conference talks.

Great conference. I have been at UIKonf in 2014 but this time it was so much better for me because I talked to so many people. It's not that the people have been more open this time.</p><p>It's more like this time I met many people I knew from Twitter and Slack channels. In addition I have been grown more into the community since 2014.</p><p>Something else was different this time. For the first time I started to do sketch notes during the talks. I'm not good with sketch notes yet meaning that I cannot draw. As a result often I had to write words instead of drawing images. Nevertheless doing sketch notes helped me to stay focused and concentrated. And I still remember what was presented in most of the talks.</p><p>After each talk I published the sketch note to twitter and shared it with the speaker(s). This way the speaker got feedback about what key points I digested.</p><!--more-->
I used Notablility on my iPad. During the talks I edited the notes if necessary, for example when I first misunderstood the point or when the visual structure could be improved by moving stuff around. But I didn't change anything after the talk was over.

And here are the notes together with the links to the videos. Have fun!

Here is why:</p><h2>Context shift</h2><p>I'm a coder. What I do best is coding. When ever I switch from code to Interface Builder I have to switch context. Interface Builder is visual. There are many places where I have to change something to get the desired look. The mouse pointer has to move long distances on screen.</p><h2>Less conflicts</h2><p>I still encounter merge conflicts for storyboards when working with others on the same project.</p><h2>Options all over the place</h2><p>The elements in iOS become more and more complex. This means there are many options for interface elements. In Interface Builder you have to click through all the inspectors to find what you are searching for. When writing code most of the times I already know the first characters for what I'm trying to do and autocompletion does the rest.</p><h2>Easier get help</h2><p>It's easier to post code than screenshots in case you need help on StackOverflow ;). If you find code on Github you can see without downloading how the interface is build.</p><h2>No betas for you</h2><p>I had a few times that a project could not be opened by Xcode when I opened it in a beta of Xcode because the Interface Builder file structure had been changed.</p><h2>No refactoring</h2><p>Code is easier to refactor than storyboards.</p><h2>No inheritance</h2><p>It is impossible to inherit from a storyboard scene. In code you can easily make subclasses to reuse code. Using a storyboard you have to make two scenes even if they share 90% of their UI elements.</p><h2>Harder to DRY</h2><p>At work I'm working on an app that has 8 targets right now (more to come). Each target has several storyboards. Differences in the interface for the different targets are managed in the different storyboards. It turned out that this isn't a good idea. We had to fix one layout bug in 16 storyboard scenes (8 universal targets). And this happens again and again. We are right now moving most of the more complex user interfaces to code to prevent repeating ourselves.</p><h2>Layout constraints</h2><p>For me it's easier to see all the constrains of a view in code. In Interface Builder I have to open the size inspector to see the constraints. And then I see the constraints of one view. And each row is one single constraint. In code when using visual format language there are several constraints in one string. For example the visual format language sting <code>"|-[nameLabel]-[button(30)]-|"</code> represents 4 constraints on three interface elements. In combination with layout format options the layout becomes much easier to understand. At least for me.</p><h2>Performance Performance Performance</h2><p>I use a MacBook Air (Early 2015) for development. The performance of Interface Builder on that machine is far from acceptable. Here are two examples (using Xcode 6.3.2) from a real project I'm working on right now:</p><img src="../../assets/open_interface_builder.gif" alt="Switching from the code editor to Interface Builder"/><img src="../../assets/select_view.gif" alt="Switching from the code editor to Interface Builder"/><p>One could argue that a MBA isn't the right machine for a developer. But in my opinion a slow machine should slow down compilation and not editing code or user interface.</p><p>I would love to hear/read what you think.
