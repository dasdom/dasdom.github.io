I write books about iOS development.

## Test-Driven iOS Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a proven way to find software bugs earlier on in software development. Writing tests before you code improves the structure and maintainability of your apps, and so using TDD in combination with Swift 5.5's improved syntax leaves you with no excuse for writing bad code.

Developers working with iOS will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to TDD in iOS. This book will help you grasp the fundamentals and show you how to run TDD with Xcode. You'll learn how to test network code, navigate between different parts of the app, run asynchronous tests, and much more. Using practical, real-world examples, you'll begin with an overview of the TDD workflow and get to grips with unit testing concepts and code cycles. You'll then develop an entire iOS app using TDD while exploring different strategies for writing tests for models, view controllers, and networking code. Additionally, you'll explore how to test the user interface and business logic of iOS apps and even write tests for the network layer of the sample app.

By the end of this TDD book, you'll be able to implement TDD methodologies comfortably in your day-to-day development for building scalable and robust applications.

## Build Location-Based Projects for iOS

Coding is awesome. So is being outside. With location-based iOS apps, you can combine the two for an enhanced outdoor experience. Use Swift to create your own apps that use GPS data, read sensor data from your iPhone, draw on maps, automate with geofences, and store augmented reality world maps. You’ll have a great time without even noticing that you’re learning. And even better, each of the projects is designed to be extended and eventually submitted to the App Store. Explore, share, and have fun.
